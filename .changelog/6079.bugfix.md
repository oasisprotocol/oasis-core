go/runtime/history: Ensure `WatchBlocks` emits sequential round sequence

Previously, if `WatchBlocks` was called on a node without local storage,
blocks were not emitted during reindexing, causing gaps in the round sequence
for clients.

Existing behaviour has been improved, so that during initial reindex,
subscribers are still not notified, however during any subsequent reindex,
all block rounds are emitted.
