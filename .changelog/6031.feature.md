`go/consensus/cometbft/roothash: Parallelize history reindex

Previously, the history reindexing of runtimes was performed sequentially
relative to each other. By parallelizing this process, we significantly
speed-up history reindex, when multiple runtimes are configured.

Moreover, this change resolves an existing issue, where adding a new runtime
could cause the reindexing of all other runtimes to be delayed until the newly
added runtime completes reindexing, even if those other runtimes were only
a few rounds away from sync.
