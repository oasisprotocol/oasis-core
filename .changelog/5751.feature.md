go: Split storage sync p2p protocol

Storage sync protocol was split into two independent protocols (checkpoint
and diff sync).

This change was made since there may be fewer nodes that expose checkpoints
than storage diff. Previously, this could lead to issues with state sync
when a node was connected with peers that supported storage sync protocol
but had no checkpoints available.

This was done in backwards compatible manner, so that both protocols are still
advertised and used. Eventually, we plan to remove legacy protocol.
