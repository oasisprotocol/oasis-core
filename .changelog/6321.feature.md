go/oasis-node: Add new command for offline pruning of consensus databases

A new experimental command `oasis-node storage prune-experimental`
was added, enabling offline pruning as specified in the configuration.

Operators are encouraged to run this command whenever they change pruning
configuration, to ensure node is healthy when it starts.
