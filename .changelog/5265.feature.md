go/oasis-node: Display consensus checkpoint heights

A new field `heights` has been added to the `oasis-node control status` output
under the `consensus.checkpoint` status section. If checkpointer is not
disabled and there is at least one checkpoint, this field displays a list
of local checkpoint heights.
