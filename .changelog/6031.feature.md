`go/consensus/cometbft/roothash: Parallelize history reindex

Previously, the history reindexing of runtimes was performed sequentially
relative to each other. By parallelizing this process, we significantly
speed-up history reindex, when multiple runtimes are configured.

Moreover, this change resolves an existing issue, where adding a new runtime
causes the reindexing and event processing of all other runtimes to be
blocked when the newly added runtime starts its history reindex.
