stateless-client: Fix incorrect GetLastRetainedHeight method

Previously, this method would return one of the provider's last retained
heights which could cause issues with runtime light history reindexing.

This has been fixed, by setting the last retained height to the
light client's last retained height, as this is the oldest height
the stateless client can use to verify consensus data against.
