# ADR 0000: Architectural Decision Records

## Changelog

- 2020-07-01: Initial version

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to record architectural decisions in a transparent way and establish a
process for contributors to propose new directions.

## Decision

We will use [Architectural Decision Records] to document architectural
decisions. The records will be stored under `docs/adr` in this repository with a
lightweight process for proposing, discussing and deciding on ADRs. The format
and process are documented in the [index page].
